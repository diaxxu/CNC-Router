# CNC-Router

This is my homemade CNC machine. It started as an idea and slowly turned into a full mission . I designed everything in Fusion 360, with 3d printed brackets. i also researched the parts, and carefully choosed components. I’m not calling it perfect, its **beautiful** and i like it  .

## Why I Made This

To get more hands on experience ? this is a very cool project. A CNC that can carve wood and maybe on a good day cut aluminuim, isn't that great ?

This is quite long, maybe I should make it shorter
