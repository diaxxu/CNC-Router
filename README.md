This is my homemade modular CNC machine, built from simple available parts. I designed everything in Fusion 360, the brackets are 3d printed, researched every component, and chose them carefully. It’s not perfect, but it’s beautiful, and I genuinely enjoyed building it.

## Why I Made This

To get more hands on experience ? this is a very cool project. A CNC that can carve wood and maybe on a good day cut aluminuim, isn't that great ?
